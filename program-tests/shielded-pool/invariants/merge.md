# Merge Invariants

Covers `MergeTransact` (tag 13) and `RingMergeTransact` (tag 16). Shared invariants
(expiry, pause, stale root, double-spend, rollback, external-hash domain separation)
live in `cross-cutting.md`.

SPEC_DIVERGENCE (resolved 2026-07-23): the spec previously described a variable input
count `N` and an oversized proof; `docs/spec.md` now matches the code: a fixed
8-in/1-out shape and a 128-byte vanilla Groth16 `a||b||c` proof with no BSB22
commitment (`program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/merge_transact.rs:9-22`,
`docs/spec.md:1795-1836`). Post-PR164 the merge output is ciphertext-free (no
`encrypted_utxo` field and no `merge_view_tag`): the output is recovered from the
first real input and its nullifier, and padding slots publish derived dummy
nullifiers.

## MergeTransact

### Account Constraints

- [x] **INV-MERGE-01: tree account must be writable**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_a_non_writable_tree`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `merge_transact` can only succeed when the first two accounts (`input_tree` and `output_tree`) are writable.

- [x] **INV-MERGE-02: payer must sign**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_an_unsigned_payer`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `merge_transact` can only succeed when the third account (`payer`) is a signer; no other authorization signer exists (any caller may merge an opted-in owner's notes).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/account.rs:23` (`fn validate_and_parse`)
  - Error: account-checks signer error
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-MERGE-03: user_record must be owned by the user-registry program with a valid record**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_a_user_record_not_owned_by_the_registry`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the `user_record` account must be owned by `USER_REGISTRY_PROGRAM_ID` and parse as a valid `UserRecord`; any violation returns Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/account.rs:58-89` (`fn load_user_record`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidUserRecord = 7018`
  - Severity: Critical (owner-binding source)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-MERGE-04: merging requires the owner's opt-in**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `merge_rejects_an_owner_that_has_not_opted_in`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `merge_transact` returns Err whenever the registry record's `merging_enabled` flag is exactly `false`.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs:43-45` (`fn process_merge_transact_ix`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::MergeDisabled = 7017`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-MERGE-05: P256 owner rail requires a registered P256 key**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_a_p256_rail_without_a_registered_p256_owner`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: when `eddsa_owner` is `false`, the registry record's `owner_p256` must be `Some`; a record without a P256 key returns Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/account.rs:77-79` (`fn load_user_record`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidUserRecord = 7018`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-MERGE-18: merge account layout — two trees, signer payer, system program**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `rejects_invalid_system_program_with_specific_error`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the `merge_transact` account layout is `input_tree` (writable), `output_tree` (writable), `payer` (signer), `user_record`, `system_program`, `program` (SPP), then the eight nullifier PDAs; the `ring_merge_transact` layout is `input_tree`, `output_tree`, `ring_config` (signer), `payer` (signer), `system_program`, `program` (SPP), then the eight nullifier PDAs; the system-program account must be the system program (it is kept in the account keys so the forester-fee Transfer CPI resolves) and the program account must be SPP (`ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId` otherwise).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/account.rs:19-36` (`fn validate_and_parse`), `merge_ring/account.rs:22-39`
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSystemProgram = 7024`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-MERGE-17: a merge past the dummy-input capacity threshold fails at proof verification**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_dummy_inputs_after_capacity_threshold`
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: when the input tree's `dummy_input_headroom()` is less than the merge's input count, the on-chain public input recomputes with the flag 0 while merge proofs are always built with `allow_dummy_inputs = true`, so `merge_transact`/`ring_merge_transact` fail pairing and roll back all queue insertions and appends.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs` (`fn process_merge_core`, `allow_dummy_inputs` leg)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: High (availability)
  - Suggested test: negative (exists; crosses the threshold by moving the nullifier queue cursor in litesvm instead of a 250-queue localnet setup); harness: litesvm

### Instruction Data Validation

- [x] **INV-MERGE-06: a supported merge shape is enforced at parse time**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_a_wrong_input_count_shape` (7, 9, 35, 37 inputs), `merge_accepts_the_wide_shape_and_fails_only_on_the_proof` (36 inputs parse and reach verification)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `merge_transact` returns Err unless `nullifiers.len()` is in `MERGE_SUPPORTED_INPUT_COUNTS` (8 or 36). The shape is the instruction's own declared input count, not a constant the program assumes; the instruction carries one `utxo_tree_root_index` / `nullifier_tree_root_index` pair for every input.
  - Location: `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/merge_transact.rs:106-115` (`fn validate_shape`), `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs:31-32`
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidMergeShape = 7019`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative + fuzz; harness: mollusk unit

- [ ] **INV-MERGE-07: the output blob must be verifiably encrypted**
  - Not applicable post-PR164 (the merge output is ciphertext-free: the `encrypted_utxo` field and the `MERGE_ENCRYPTED_UTXO_*` constants were removed; the owner recovers the output from the first input and its nullifier). The covering `merge_rejects_a_wrong_encrypted_output_scheme` test was removed with the field.

### Proof Binding

- [x] **INV-MERGE-08: the proof binds the owner's registered signing key**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `merge_rejects_a_proof_bound_to_a_foreign_user_record` (a proof bound to owner A submitted with owner B's `user_record` fails with 7008; the substitution changes the bound signing_pk_field and the event tag, both derived from the record)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the merge public-input hash folds `signing_pk_field` derived exactly from the registry record, so a proof built for a different owner than the supplied `user_record` fails verification.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/account.rs:58-89` (`fn load_user_record`), `merge/verify.rs:84-115` (`fn public_input_hash`, `Registry` arm)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical (owner substitution)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [ ] **INV-MERGE-09: the proof binds the owner's registered viewing key**
  - Not applicable post-PR164 (the merge encryption flow was restructured: the output is ciphertext-free and recovered by the owner from the first input and its nullifier, so no viewing-key public input exists; F-06 re-reviewed 2026-07-27 and closed as MOOT -- no recipient viewing key enters any circuit KDF anymore).

- [ ] **INV-MERGE-10: the ciphertext hash is recomputed on-chain**
  - Not applicable post-PR164 (no merge ciphertext exists, so there is nothing to recompute on-chain).

- [x] **INV-MERGE-11: the merge proof is vanilla Groth16 with the variant's key**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `default_rail_merge_rejects_a_zeroed_proof_exactly` (7008), `default_rail_merge_rejects_undecompressable_proof_points_exactly` (7007); positive side at both declared counts by `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/functional.rs` `merge_collects_the_exact_forester_fee_from_the_payer` (8 inputs) and `merge_verifies_the_wide_shape_on_chain` (36 inputs), each proving with the workspace prover and requiring the program to accept
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `merge_transact` decodes the fixed 128-byte proof as `a||b||c` (no commitment) and verifies it only against the key for its owner binding and its declared input count: `merge_8_1` / `merge_36_1` (default rail), `merge_ring_8_1` / `merge_ring_36_1` (ring rail). Merge instruction data has no circuit selector, so a count with no key is refused rather than verified against another width's key. A proof whose points fail decompression returns the encoding error, a non-verifying proof returns the verification error.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/verify.rs:51-73` (`fn verify`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactProofEncoding = 7007` / `TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative both errors; harness: mollusk unit

- [ ] **INV-MERGE-12: registry public-input shape is the 7-element prefix plus both owner keys**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `eddsa_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` (successful end-to-end verification exercises the chain; no explicit element-count/order assertion)
  - Kind: state
  - Statement: the `merge_transact` public-input hash chains the 7-element prefix (nullifier-chain, output hash, tree-slot chain, output tree id, `private_tx_hash`, `external_data_hash`, `allow_dummy_inputs`) and then folds `signing_pk_field` and `nullifier_pk` from the registry record.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/verify.rs:84-115` (`fn public_input_hash`)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: property (compare against client-side computation in `sdk-libs/keypair`); harness: `cargo test -p`

### Success Postconditions

- [ ] **INV-MERGE-13: exactly 8 nullifiers are inserted and one leaf appended**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `eddsa_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` (output appended and inputs spent; the exact +8 queue / +1 tree `next_index` deltas are not asserted)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: after a successful `merge_transact`, the nullifier queue's `next_index` is exactly its value before plus 8, and the UTXO tree's `next_index` is exactly its value before plus 1 with the appended leaf equal to `output_utxo_hash`.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs:141-172` (`fn apply_input_tree`), `merge/processor.rs:174-189` (`fn apply_output_tree`)
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: positive; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [ ] **INV-MERGE-14: successful merge emits exactly one Merge GeneralEvent tagged by the owner key**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `eddsa_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` (output rediscovered by owner signing-key tag; nullifier sequence numbers, verbatim `data`, and the empty `spl_transfers` list unasserted)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: after a successful `merge_transact`, exactly one self-CPI `EmitEvent` inner instruction is recorded whose `GeneralEvent` carries the 8 nullifiers with assigned queue sequence numbers and exactly one output whose `view_tag` is the owner's signing-key tag from the registry record and whose `data` is empty (ciphertext-free output), and an empty `spl_transfers` list (no public movements).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/event.rs:15-42` (`fn build_merge_event`), `merge/account.rs:58-89`
  - Severity: Medium (owner rediscovery on sync)
  - Suggested test: positive; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-MERGE-19: merge collects the tree's insertion fee for 8 queued nullifiers and credits the fee balance**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/functional.rs` `merge_collects_the_exact_forester_fee_from_the_payer` (real on-chain merge proof; the input tree gains exactly `8 * fees.fee_per_nullifier` lamports read from the tree header, its `fee_balance` grows by the same amount, the payer loses exactly the signature fee plus that amount, every other account byte-identical); also `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `actor_owned_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` and `eddsa_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` via the shared merge action, which asserts the payer loses and the input tree gains exactly `MERGE_INPUT_COUNT` (8) × the tree's per-nullifier fee (`spp-test-validator/tests/actions/merge.rs`)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: while queueing the inputs the input tree's `fee_balance` increases by exactly `fee = MERGE_INPUT_COUNT` (8) × `input_tree.fees.fee_per_nullifier` (the schedule stored in the tree header; no constant fee exists any more), and the payer then transfers exactly `fee` lamports to the input tree via one System-Program CPI before the PDAs are funded; a fee-computation overflow returns 7022; a zero fee (all-zero schedule) skips the CPI; the tree must be writable and program-owned else 7001.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs` (`fn process_merge_core`: `credit_insertion_fee(MERGE_INPUT_COUNT)`, `create_nullifier_pdas`), `nullifier_pda/create.rs` (`fn create_nullifier_pdas`, `fn collect_forester_fee`), `program-libs/tree/src/fees.rs` (`fn TreeAccount::credit_insertion_fee`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidForesterFee = 7022`
  - Severity: High (fund movement)
  - Suggested test: none remaining (exact deltas pinned; 7022 overflow legs covered by `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/tree/contract.rs` `forester_fee_overflow_is_invalid_forester_fee`, `reimbursement_recipient_balance_overflow_is_invalid_forester_fee`)

### Frame Conditions

- [x] **INV-MERGE-15: merge modifies only the two tree accounts and the payer**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/functional.rs` `merge_collects_the_exact_forester_fee_from_the_payer` (every account other than the trees and the payer byte-identical); `program-tests/spp-test-validator/tests/lifecycle.rs` `actor_owned_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` and `eddsa_merge_covers_every_supported_input_count` via the shared merge action, which asserts the payer loses exactly 8 × the tree's `fees.fee_per_nullifier`, the input tree gains exactly that amount, and the read-only user record is unchanged around every successful merge (`spp-test-validator/tests/actions/merge.rs`); the remaining instruction account is the system program, which cannot be modified by the program.
  - Kind: frame
  - Statement: after a successful `merge_transact`, every account other than the two tree accounts (`input_tree`, `output_tree`) and the `payer` has unchanged data and unchanged lamports (no settlement exists on this instruction); the only lamport movement is the insertion fee (`MERGE_INPUT_COUNT` × `input_tree.fees.fee_per_nullifier`, credited to the tree's `fee_balance`; zero under the sponsored default, which skips the transfer) from the payer to the input tree; in particular the `user_record` is read-only.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs` (`fn process_merge_transact_ix`, `fn process_merge_core`: `credit_insertion_fee`, `create_nullifier_pdas`), `nullifier_pda/create.rs` (`fn collect_forester_fee`)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: positive; harness: mollusk unit (account snapshot compare)

### Nullifier Integrity

- [x] **INV-MERGE-16: dummy merge slots publish the derived MergeDummyNullifier**
  - Covered by: `prover/server/circuits/spp_merge/dummy_nullifier_attack_test.go` `TestMergeRejectsVictimNullifierInDummySlot`, `TestMergeAcceptsDerivedDummyNullifiers`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: for every padding input slot in a merge, the published nullifier equals exactly the deterministic `MergeDummyNullifier(nullifier_secret, first_nullifier, slot_index)` derivation — seeded with the owner's nullifier secret, deliberately *not* the first input blinding (which that UTXO's sender also knows) — so a merge delegate cannot park a real wallet nullifier in a padding slot (the F-03 fix).
  - Location: `prover/server/circuits/spp_merge/shared/derivation.go:38-47` (`MergeDummyNullifier`, domain `TMDN`), dummy-slot constraints in `prover/server/circuits/spp_merge/`
  - Error: circuit constraint failure (proof cannot be constructed)
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative (victim's real nullifier placed in a dummy slot) + positive (derived dummies verify); harness: Go circuit tests (`go test ./circuits/spp_merge`)

## RingMergeTransact

### Account Constraints

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-01: ring_config must sign**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_ring_rejects_an_unsigned_ring_config`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_merge_transact` can only succeed when the third account (`ring_config`) is a signer.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/account.rs:26` (`fn validate_and_parse`)
  - Error: account-checks signer error
  - Severity: Critical (ring authorization)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-02: ring_config must be a valid SPP-owned RingConfig**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_ring_rejects_a_ring_config_with_a_wrong_owner`, `merge_ring_rejects_a_ring_config_with_a_wrong_discriminator`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the `ring_config` account must be owned by the shielded-pool program with `data_len` exactly 69 and discriminator 4; any violation returns Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/ring_config/loader.rs:14-20` (`fn load_ring_config`), `merge_ring/account.rs:27`
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidRingConfig = 7014`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-14: a paused ring cannot merge**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_ring_rejects_a_paused_ring_config`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: after signer and structural validation, `ring_merge_transact` returns `RingPaused` whenever `ring_config.paused` is nonzero and performs no state mutation.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/ring_config/loader.rs` (`fn load_active_ring_config`), `merge_ring/account.rs` (`fn validate_and_parse`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::RingPaused = 7042`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-03: payer must sign**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_ring_rejects_an_unsigned_payer`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_merge_transact` can only succeed when the fourth account (`payer`) is a signer.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/account.rs:28` (`fn validate_and_parse`)
  - Error: account-checks signer error
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-04: no registry opt-in is consulted**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `ring_merge_consolidates_inputs`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_merge_transact` succeeds without a `user_record` account and regardless of any registry `merging_enabled` flag; authorization is exactly the ring_config signature.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/processor.rs:25-70` (`fn process_merge_ring_ix`)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: positive; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

### Instruction Data Validation

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-05: shape checks equal merge_transact's**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` `merge_ring_rejects_a_wrong_input_count_shape_exactly` (7019)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_merge_transact` rejects, exactly as INV-MERGE-06, every embedded merge body whose element vectors are not length 8.
  - Location: `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/merge_ring.rs` (`MergeRingIxDataRef::from_bytes`), `merge_ring/processor.rs`
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidMergeShape = 7019`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

### Proof Binding

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-06: the proof binds the signing ring's program id**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `ring_merge_rejects_a_proof_bound_to_another_ring` (the same ring fixture is deployed under two program IDs; a proof built for ring A is submitted through ring B's valid signer/config and fails with 7008 while the tree remains unchanged).
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the ring-merge public-input hash folds `Poseidon(low, high)` of the signing `ring_config.program_id` as its final element; a proof built for a different ring fails verification.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/processor.rs:42-52` (`fn process_merge_ring_ix`), `merge/verify.rs:101-110` (`fn public_input_hash`, `Ring` arm)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical (cross-ring merge prevention)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [ ] **INV-RING-MERGE-07: ring merge verifies only against merge_ring_8_1**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `invalid_proofs_and_disabled_authority_are_atomic` (zeroed proof -> 7008; a real `merge_8_1` proof cross-submitted to ring merge is not tested)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_merge_transact` verifies only against `merge_ring_8_1::VERIFYINGKEY`; a proof for the default `merge_8_1` circuit does not verify (the two key selections are mutually exclusive by owner-binding variant).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/verify.rs:62-73` (`fn verify`, key selection and `verify_groth16` call)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [ ] **INV-RING-MERGE-08: ring public-input shape is the 7-element prefix plus ring data and ring id**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `ring_merge_consolidates_inputs` (successful end-to-end verification exercises the chain; no explicit element-count assertion)
  - Kind: state
  - Statement: the `ring_merge_transact` public-input hash chains the 7-element prefix (as in INV-MERGE-12) and then folds `output_ring_data_hash` and `ring_program_id`; it folds no signing or viewing key field (owner identity is omitted by design).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/verify.rs:84-115` (`fn public_input_hash`, `Ring` arm)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: property (client-side comparison); harness: `cargo test -p`

### Success Postconditions

- [ ] **INV-RING-MERGE-09: merge_view_tag is single-use**
  - Not applicable post-PR164 (the `merge_view_tag` field was removed; replay protection comes from the queued proof-bound input nullifiers themselves -- INV-RING-MERGE-12).

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-10: the emitted output is indexed by the first input nullifier**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `ring_merge_consolidates_inputs`
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: after a successful `ring_merge_transact`, the emitted `GeneralEvent`'s single output is indexed by the first input's published nullifier (there is no instruction-supplied tag).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/processor.rs:54-69` (`fn process_merge_ring_ix`), `merge/event.rs:15-42`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: positive; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-11: external hash uses the ring-merge discriminator**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `ring_merge_rejects_a_default_merge_proof` (a valid discriminator-13 merge proof built from default-ring UTXOs is submitted unchanged through discriminator 16 and rejected atomically with 7008).
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the recomputed `external_data_hash` for `ring_merge_transact` uses `spp_instruction_discriminator` exactly 16 (`RING_MERGE_TRANSACT`), so a proof built for `merge_transact` (discriminator 13) with identical fields fails verification.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/processor.rs:34-40` (`fn process_merge_ring_ix`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: High (cross-instruction replay)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [ ] **INV-RING-MERGE-13: ring merge event publishes the output ring_data_hash**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `ring_merge_consolidates_inputs` (successful ring merge exercises the emit; the output `data` payload is not field-asserted)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the emitted `GeneralEvent`'s single output carries `output_ring_data_hash` as its `data` payload (default merge: empty data), and the proof binds that same hash (INV-RING-MERGE-08), so a relayer cannot alter the published ring binding.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/processor.rs:57-69` (`fn process_merge_ring_ix`), `merge/event.rs:15-42` (`fn build_merge_event`)
  - Severity: Medium (wallet reconstruction)
  - Suggested test: positive (assert the event output `data` equals `output_ring_data_hash`); harness: litesvm

### Nullifier Integrity

- [x] **INV-RING-MERGE-12: merge_ring queues exactly the proof-bound input nullifiers**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/merge/contract.rs` shape tests; compile-level absence of the removed merge_view_tag field in `MergeRingIxData` (`program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/merge_ring.rs`)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: after a successful `ring_merge_transact`, exactly the proof's 8 input nullifiers are queued and nothing else: the single-use `merge_view_tag` field no longer exists, the emitted output is indexed by the first input nullifier, and `output_ring_data_hash` is proof-bound (eliminates the unvalidated-tag queue-poisoning class, F-02/F-09).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge_ring/processor.rs:57-69` (`fn process_merge_ring_ix`), `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/verify.rs:23-27, 102-110` (`MergeOwnerBinding::Ring`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::NullifierTreeUpdateFailed = 7002` (replay), `TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008` (binding mismatch)
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative (replay) + negative (foreign-ring proof); harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

## Merge Cache

Both tags may carry a `cache_slot: Option<u8>` plus a trailing `CacheAccount` PDA and write-authority signer
(`program-libs/interface/src/state/cache.rs`), so these entries apply to
`MergeTransact` and `RingMergeTransact` alike and keep the `INV-MERGE` prefix for
that reason. Three mechanisms are deliberately separate: the write authority
governs insertion, nullification governs spending, and the timeout governs
closure. The cache binds no owner. The
cached *spend* rail belongs to `Transact` and `RingTransact`: every owner-signed
circuit folds a cache selection into its public input hash whether or not a cache
is supplied, so a cached spend verifies against its rail's ordinary verifying key
and no standalone cached circuit exists
(`program-libs/interface/src/verifying_keys/circuit.rs`, `fn CircuitId::uncached`).
`CircuitId` carries one cached twin per owner-signed rail --
`ConfidentialEddsaCached`, `RingEddsaCached`, `RingP256Cached` -- and
`RingAuthority` has none, because its circuit binds no selection. INV-MERGE-23
records why the spend needs no identity check; its `CacheSlotEmpty`,
`InvalidCacheBitmap` and `InvalidCacheRootIndex` legs are pinned there rather
than by entries of their own.

### Write Authorization

- [x] **INV-MERGE-20: a merge writes a cache only with its write authority's signature**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/functional.rs` `merge_writes_the_bound_slot` and `ring_merge_writes_the_bound_slot` (`reject_cache_sponsor_write`: the rent sponsor signing in the writer's place fails with 7076 and leaves every writable account unchanged; the same proof then succeeds with the writer and a distinct payer), `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_invalid_writes_and_rolls_back_overwrites` (out-of-range slot -> 7069, expired cache -> 7073, a P256 registry owner reaching the proof -> 7008, each with the cache and tree unchanged)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `merge_transact` and `merge_ring` load a named cache once, before the proof, and return Err unless the signer immediately after it equals the stored `write_authority`, the cache has not expired and the slot is in range. No owner is compared on either rail: the write authority alone decides which verified outputs reach the slots, for registry owners of either curve and for policy-ring users. The default merge proof still binds the registered signing identity and nullifier public key (INV-MERGE-12), so the output it writes belongs to the registry owner.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/cache.rs` (`fn parse_cache_accounts`, `fn load_merge_cache`), `instructions/cache/write.rs` (`fn CacheWrite::load`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::CacheWriteAuthorityMismatch = 7076`, `CacheExpired = 7073`, `InvalidCacheSlot = 7069`
  - Severity: Critical (cache takeover)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: litesvm + program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [x] **INV-MERGE-21: a cache accepts only outputs appended to its own tree**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/functional.rs` `merge_rejects_a_cache_for_another_tree` (real proof, 7071, the cache is byte-identical afterwards), `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/queued.rs` `ten_proofs_in_parallel_then_sequential_splits_and_delayed_spends` (a transact write to a cache retagged to another tree -> 7071)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: every write compares the cache's `tree_id` with the output tree before the proof is verified, on both merge rails and on transact. A cached spend proves its commitments under the cache's tree (INV-MERGE-23), so a commitment from another tree could never be spent from the slot.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/cache/write.rs` (`fn CacheWrite::check_output_tree`), `merge/processor.rs` (`fn process_merge_core`), `transact/cache.rs` (`fn check_cache_output_tree`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::CacheTreeMismatch = 7071`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [x] **INV-MERGE-22: a proof names its cache destination**
  - Covered by: `program-libs/interface/tests/merge_shape.rs` `cache_mode_address_and_slot_are_bound_by_both_merge_hashes` (both merge tags, every address and slot change moves the external data hash), `sdk-libs/program/tests/cache.rs` `cache_write_binding_commits_to_destination_writes_and_external_data`, `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/queued.rs` `ten_proofs_in_parallel_then_sequential_splits_and_delayed_spends` (a proven transact redirected to another cache or given other write slots -> 7008, atomically)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the merge rails fold the cache address and slot into `MergeExternalDataHash`, and transact folds the cache address and write bitmap into its external data hash (`bind_cache_write`), so a relayer holding the writer's signature still cannot move a proven output to another cache or slot. A read-only transact binds no destination and keeps its original preimage.
  - Location: `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/merge_transact.rs` (`MergeExternalDataHash`), `program-libs/interface/src/state/cache.rs` (`fn bind_cache_write`), `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/cache.rs` (`fn bind_cache_write`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [x] **INV-MERGE-23: the cache substitutes for the inclusion proof, never for authority**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/functional.rs` `transact_spends_cached_commitments_without_mutating_the_cache` (real cached spend leaves the complete account unchanged even after expiry, appends outputs and queues nullifiers, and rejects replay) and `a_cached_spend_rejects_every_broken_cache_binding` (one proven instruction, each binding broken in turn: a dropped trailing cache account -> 7009, an emptied selected slot -> 7068, and a cache retagged to another tree -> 7008, with every refused spend preserving the cache); plus `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/validate_circuit.rs` `a_cached_selector_must_fit_the_inputs_the_outputs_and_the_cache` (7070 on both the confidential and ring twins) and `a_cached_selector_is_accepted_exactly_where_its_rail_is` (each cached twin is accepted by its own instruction tag and by no other, 7035)
  - Kind: state
  - Statement: The write-authority signature authorizes insertion only, because a merge output has no nullifier yet and nothing else could authorize placing it in a slot. Spending is authorized by the proof instead: the selected commitments are chained into the transact public-input hash and the circuit independently requires ownership and a valid nullifier for each selected input, so referencing another party's cache forces you to spend their UTXO. That argument is the same on every owner-signed rail, which is why each of them binds the selection and none of them needs a cached circuit of its own. A selection that reads no input publishes the uncached selection, so a write-only selector's public inputs equal those of a spend without a cache. The spend path consequently checks no identity and no expiry; its two checks are deliberately not ownership checks -- `CacheTreeMismatch` because the commitments stand in for that tree's inclusion, `CacheSlotEmpty` because the bitmap selected a slot nothing ever wrote.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs` (`fn assign_cached_inputs`), `transact/tree.rs` (`fn resolve_input_tree_slot`), `program-libs/interface/src/state/cache.rs` (`fn cached_input_fields`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::CacheTreeMismatch = 7071`, `CacheSlotEmpty = 7068`
  - Severity: Critical (double-spend boundary)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-MERGE-24: overwrites are writer-authorized and reads precede writes**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/queued.rs` `ten_proofs_in_parallel_then_sequential_splits_and_delayed_spends`; `merge_writes_the_bound_slot` and `ring_merge_writes_the_bound_slot` exercise overwriting with a payer independent of the writer.
  - Kind: state
  - Statement: a cache has no frozen or spent flag. Only an explicit write-authority signer can replace slots, and every replacement comes from a verified output with the correct tree binding. Transact loads the cache once, writable exactly when it writes, reconstructs its input commitments from the contents before any write, and checks the writer, expiry and tree before the proof. Cache writes bind the destination address and bitmap through external data; any later proof or settlement failure rolls back all mutations. Nullifiers protect both cached and tree spends.
  - Error: `CacheWriteAuthorityMismatch`, `CacheExpired`, `CacheTreeMismatch`, `TransactProofVerificationFailed`
  - Severity: Critical

### Lifecycle

- [x] **INV-MERGE-25: create is permissionless and its address belongs to the signing sponsor**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/contract.rs` `create_is_idempotent_and_close_refunds_sponsor` and `create_is_permissionless_and_scoped_to_the_signing_sponsor` (a second sponsor reusing the nonce lands at a different address and leaves the first untouched)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `create_cache` takes `payer` (signer, stored as `rent_sponsor`), `cache` (writable) and the system program, with no owner and no `ring_config` signer, and derives the PDA from `[CACHE_SEED, rent_sponsor, nonce]` with a canonical bump. Because the sponsor signs, no third party can create that address at all, so nobody can pre-create a conflicting configuration to block a legitimate create.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/cache/create.rs` (`fn process_create_cache`), `instructions/shared.rs` (`fn verify_pda`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidCache = 7066`
  - Severity: High (availability)
  - Suggested test: positive + negative; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-MERGE-26: `tree_id`, `expires_at`, `rent_sponsor` and `write_authority` are immutable**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/contract.rs` `create_and_close_reject_unauthorized_configuration` (`tree_id`, `expires_at` and `write_authority` mismatches -> 7067)
  - Kind: state
  - Statement: a repeated `create_cache` on an existing account compares `write_authority`, `tree_id` and `expires_at` and returns Err on any difference, and it never compares or resets `utxo_hashes`. The derivation already fixes `rent_sponsor` and the bump. A re-send can therefore neither extend the timeout nor clear the cache.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/cache/create.rs` (`fn process_create_cache`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::CacheConfigMismatch = 7067`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative per field; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-MERGE-27: an expired cache accepts no further writes**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/contract.rs` `merge_rejects_invalid_writes_and_rolls_back_overwrites` (expired case -> 7073), `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/queued.rs` `ten_proofs_in_parallel_then_sequential_splits_and_delayed_spends` (expired transact write -> 7073) and `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/contract.rs` `create_is_permissionless_and_scoped_to_the_signing_sponsor` (an `expires_at` that is not in the future -> 7075)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: both merge rails and transact reject a write once `Clock::unix_timestamp >= expires_at`, and `create_cache` rejects an `expires_at` that is not in the future with its own error. Entries inserted before expiry stay spendable until the account is closed, and the merged outputs stay spendable afterwards regardless: `process_merge_core` appends the output to the output tree before it touches the cache, and does so whether or not a cache is supplied.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/cache/write.rs` (`fn CacheWrite::load`), `cache/create.rs` (`fn process_create_cache`), `merge/processor.rs` (`fn process_merge_core`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::CacheExpired = 7073`, `CacheExpiryNotInFuture = 7075`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: litesvm

- [x] **INV-MERGE-28: closure requires expiry or the writer, and refunds the stored sponsor**
  - Covered by: `create_is_idempotent_and_close_refunds_sponsor`, `create_and_close_reject_unauthorized_configuration`, and `writer_can_close_before_expiry_and_only_refund_sponsor` in `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/cache/contract.rs`.
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `close_cache` takes the writable cache, writable rent recipient and optional writer signer. Before expiry the signer must match `write_authority`; after expiry anyone may close. Both paths transfer the whole balance to `rent_sponsor` and to no other recipient. This applies to every cache.
  - Error: `CacheNotExpired`, `CacheWriteAuthorityMismatch`, `CacheRentRecipientMismatch`, `InvalidSigner`
  - Severity: High (rent custody)
