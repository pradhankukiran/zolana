# Transact Invariants

Covers `Transact` (tag 12), `RingTransact` (tag 15), `RingAuthorityTransact` (tag 17).
Invariants shared with other instructions (expiry, pause, stale root, double-spend,
rollback, rail/vk separation, external_data_hash, settlement amount semantics) live
in `cross-cutting.md`.

All three tags parse the same `TransactIxDataRef` and run the same shared core
(`process_transact_ix`), so the instruction-data invariants INV-TRANSACT-07..12,
the settlement invariants INV-TRANSACT-13..17, the tree/settlement postconditions
INV-TRANSACT-23..28, and the frame conditions INV-TRANSACT-29..30 apply verbatim to
`RingTransact` and `RingAuthorityTransact`; they are stated once here (this file
covers the whole group) and referenced from the coverage matrix.

## Transact

### Account Constraints

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-01: payer must sign**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/settlement.rs` `sol_withdrawal_rejects_an_unsigned_payer_meta`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `transact` can only succeed when the first account (`payer`) is a signer.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:32` (`fn validate_and_parse`)
  - Error: account-checks error (not a `ShieldedPoolError`)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-02: tree accounts must be writable**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_a_non_writable_tree_meta`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `transact` can only succeed when `output_tree` (index 1) and every input tree in the dynamic run after the fixed prefix are writable.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:33-34` (`fn validate_and_parse`)
  - Error: account-checks error / `TreeError::NotWritable` path
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-03: tree accounts must be program-owned with tree discriminator**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_a_tree_not_owned_by_the_program`, `transact_rejects_a_tree_with_a_wrong_discriminator`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `transact` returns Err for every tree account (`input_tree` or `output_tree`) that is not owned by the shielded-pool program or whose first byte is not exactly `TREE_ACCOUNT_DISCRIMINATOR` (1).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:77-98` (`fn process_transact_ix`), `program-libs/tree/src/lib.rs:192-204` (`fn from_account_view_mut`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTreeAccounts = 7001`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-04: every eddsa-owned input's signer account must sign**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `transact_rejects_unsigned_eddsa_input_owner`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: for every input, the account at `eddsa_signer_index` in the raw account list must be a signer (an index of 255 — the retired P256 sentinel — is rejected with 7006 at selector validation); a non-signer account at that index makes the instruction return Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs:41-59` (`fn check_input_signers`)
  - Error: account-checks signer error; missing index: `ProgramError::NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Severity: Critical (spend authorization)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-05: input owner hash binds the signer key**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `transact_rejects_a_substituted_input_signer`
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the signer run — payer first, then first-occurrence-deduplicated eddsa owner signers — is folded into the public input as a fixed-width right-folded chain of `solana_pk_hash` values (`hash_bytes`, which packs the 32 bytes big-endian into 31-byte + 1-byte chunks and folds `Poseidon(chunk_0, chunk_1)`); the circuit checks each input's ownership against a chain element, so substituting a different signer account changes the chain and the proof no longer verifies.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs` (`fn fill_owner_signer_hashes`, `fn fixed_signer_hash_chain`), `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/hash.rs` (`fn solana_pk_hash`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical (spend authorization)
  - Suggested test: negative + property; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-45: the signer run is payer-first, deduplicated, and width-bounded**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/signer_run.rs` (`owner_signers_are_first_occurrence_deduplicated_with_payer_first`, `owner_signer_run_is_bounded_by_max_signers`, `consolidation_shape_rejects_an_owner_signer_run_past_its_slots`, `zero_suffix_optimization_matches_fixed_width_right_fold`, `zero_suffix_constants_cover_every_supported_width`, `fixed_signer_hash_chain_rejects_empty_signer_prefix`), `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `transact_rejects_unsigned_eddsa_input_owner`. The overflow case is a unit test: the address budget that fixes `owner_signer_slots` also stops a transaction from carrying enough signer accounts to overrun the bound end to end.
  - Kind: precondition + postcondition
  - Statement: authorization identities come from the accounts array, not instruction data: slot 0 is the payer (a duplicate payer in `owner_signers` is ignored), then the eddsa owner signers in first-occurrence order; the owner signer run must not exceed `owner_signer_slots(n_inputs) = min(n_inputs, 64 - 4 - n_inputs)` accounts and the unique prefix must be non-empty and fit `MAX_SIGNERS` (the widest `Shape::signer_width`, 25) slots (more returns 7006), and every owner-signer account must actually sign. The public input folds the run as a right-folded chain zero-padded to `Shape::signer_width = owner_signer_slots(n_inputs) + 1` (a one-element run folds to itself), so the witness and the on-chain recompute agree on exactly one canonical encoding of any signer set.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs` (`fn fill_owner_signer_hashes`, `fn fixed_signer_hash_chain`, `SIGNER_ZERO_SUFFIX_CHAINS`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactShape = 7006` (an unsigned would-be owner signer ends the run at the loader's first-non-signer scan, leaving an unparsable account)
  - Severity: Critical (spend authorization)
  - Suggested test: unit (exists) + negative overflow + negative unsigned owner (exist); harness: `cargo test -p shielded-pool-tests --test transact_signer_run` + program-tests integration

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-06: P256-owned inputs are authorized in-circuit (RingP256 only)**
  - Covered by: `prover/server/circuits/spp_transaction/shared/custom_p256_test.go` (`TestCustomRingP256Solves`, `TestCustomRingP256KeepsRingOnlyOwnerPrivate`, `TestCustomRingP256AcceptsMixedOwners`), `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/p256_ring_lifecycle.rs`
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: on the RingP256 rail there is no per-input signer element (and no shared `p256_signing_pk_x` instruction field): ownership is proved inside the circuit by a P256 signature over `Sha256(private_tx_hash || external_data_hash)`, split low/high as public inputs; the owner's pubkey x-coordinate is exposed on the wire as `RingP256ProofData.default_owner_tag` ONLY when a real default-ring P256 input is present (ring-only P256 ownership stays private). The confidential (default-ring) transact rail has no P256 variant — that scope stays not applicable.
  - Location: `sdk-libs/client/src/prover/transact/ring_p256.rs`, `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs` (`fn public_input_hash`, `is_p256()` appendix)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical (spend authorization)
  - Suggested test: positive per ownership layout (exists, Go) + on-chain owner-tag binding (exists); harness: `go test` + program-tests integration

- [ ] **INV-TRANSACT-40: input/output tree split**
  - Partial coverage: all functional tests exercise the two-account layout; no test asserts distinct input/output trees.
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the account layout is `payer` (signer), `output_tree` (writable), SPP, System Program, optional ring config, input trees, nullifier PDAs, owner signers, and settlement groups; all trees are loaded with owner/discriminator/pause checks; nullifiers queue into the input tree (which also supplies both root histories and the `allow_dummy_inputs` flag and receives the forester fee), outputs append to the output tree, and the emitted event records the output tree's address. The program does not require the two to be the same account. (Replaces the single-`tree` wording of INV-TRANSACT-02/03.)
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:32-36`, `transact/processor.rs:77-98`, `transact/tree.rs`
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTreeAccounts = 7001` / `ShieldedPoolError::TreePaused = 7013`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: positive with two distinct tree accounts; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-41: trailing system program account is mandatory**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_a_wrong_trailing_system_program_account` (merge-side unit also exists, see INV-MERGE-18)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the fixed prefix account at index 3 must be the system program (kept in the account keys so the forester-fee Transfer CPI resolves); any other address returns Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:115-118` (`fn from_iter`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSystemProgram = 7024`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

### Instruction Data Validation

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-07: malformed wincode payload is rejected**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_a_malformed_wincode_payload` (program-level built-in `ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData` asserted). Note: post-PR164 the ref decoder is exact-length, so trailing bytes are also rejected at parse; `transact_rejects_trailing_payload_bytes_at_parse` covers that boundary.
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: every payload that `TransactIxDataRef::from_bytes` fails to parse (truncated, wrong enum tag, overlong length prefix) makes `transact` return Err before any account is read.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:43-44` (`fn process_transact_ix`)
  - Error: `ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData` (built-in, not 7000)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: fuzz + negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-08: more than 8 outputs is rejected**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_more_outputs_than_any_circuit_supports`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: every instruction with strictly more than `MAX_OUTPUTS` (8) outputs returns Err during output resolution.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/event.rs:22-35` (`fn resolve_outputs`), `verify.rs:22` (`MAX_OUTPUTS`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactShape = 7006`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-09: an input count with no circuit is rejected**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_more_inputs_than_any_circuit_supports` (six inputs); positive side at the widest shape by `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `transact_accepts_the_consolidation_shape`, `ring_transact_accepts_the_consolidation_shape` and `ring_p256_transact_accepts_the_consolidation_shape` (36 inputs, real proofs)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: every instruction whose input count matches no circuit returns Err before proof verification, before any tree write. The supported counts are 1 to 5 plus the 36-input consolidation shape (`Shape::IN36_OUT2`), so six inputs is rejected while thirty-six is accepted; `MAX_INPUTS` (36) sizes the program's buffers and is not itself the check.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs:53-56` (`fn check_input_signers`), `transact/tree.rs:25-29` (`fn apply_input_tree`), `verify.rs:20` (`MAX_INPUTS`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactShape = 7006`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-10: owner-tag account index out of range is rejected**
  - Covered by: `program-libs/interface/tests/transact.rs` `fetch_tag_resolves_every_variant`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: every output whose `OwnerTag::Account(i)` references an index with no account in the transaction makes the instruction return Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/event.rs:27-32` (`fn resolve_outputs`), `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/transact.rs:225-235` (`fn fetch_tag`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::OwnerTagAccountMissing = 7021`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-11: a RingP256 proof with an invalid BSB22 commitment is rejected before pairing**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/p256_ring_lifecycle.rs` `p256_ring_transfer_updates_recipient_wallet` (bad-commitment leg)
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: a `CircuitId::RingP256` selector whose embedded `RingP256ProofData.bsb22_commitment` does not verify against the proof returns the encoding error before any pairing work. (The pre-PR164 `P256SigningKey` owner-tag variant and `p256_signing_pk_x` field did NOT return; `OwnerTag` is `Inline`/`Account` only — the decode-level rejection of the retired discriminant is covered by INV-XC-32.)
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs` (`fn verify`, commitment leg)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactProofEncoding = 7007`
  - Severity: Critical (spend authorization)
  - Suggested test: negative (exists); harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [ ] **INV-TRANSACT-12: both public amounts set is rejected**
  - Not applicable post-PR164 (the `public_sol_amount`/`public_spl_amount` fields were replaced by an ordered `interface_transfers` list; multiple legs -- including SOL and SPL legs in one instruction -- are legal and settle independently per leg, so the both-present guard is unnecessary). The covering `both_public_amounts_are_rejected` test was removed with the fields.

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-34: circuit selector family must match the dispatched tag**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/validate_circuit.rs` `selector_family_must_match_instruction`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: before any account is read, `Transact` accepts only `CircuitId::ConfidentialEddsa`, `RingTransact` only `RingEddsa`, `RingAuthorityTransact` only `RingAuthority`; any other selector returns Err. The untrusted selector is validated before it may drive account parsing, proof-input layout, or key selection.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:139-151` (`fn validate_circuit_type`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::MismatchedCircuitType = 7035`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative per (tag, selector family) pair; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-35: selector shape must equal the payload shape and be supported**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/validate_circuit.rs` `selector_dimensions_are_fail_closed`, `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `transact_rejects_an_unsupported_proof_shape`, `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/signer_run.rs` `owner_signer_run_is_bounded_by_max_signers`, `program-libs/interface/tests/circuit.rs` `supported_shapes_are_fail_closed`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the instruction returns Err unless `circuit.num_inputs() == inputs.len()`, `circuit.num_outputs() == outputs.len()`, `circuit.num_public_asset_slots() <= N_PUBLIC_SLOTS` (3), `circuit.is_supported()`, and the payer-first deduplicated signer run fits `owner_signer_slots(n_inputs)` owner accounts and the fixed-width `MAX_SIGNERS` (the widest `Shape::signer_width`, 25) array. The retired per-input `eddsa_signer_index` field (and its 255 P256 sentinel) is deleted from the wire: fail-closed is the fixed-width `InputUtxo` decode plus the signer-run bound, not a field check.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:152-163` (`fn validate_circuit_type`); supported-shape table `program-libs/interface/src/verifying_keys/circuit.rs:73-96`; signer-run bound `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs` (`fn from_iter`, `owner_signer_slots`) and `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs` (`fn fill_owner_signer_hashes`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactShape = 7006`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative per dimension; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-36: interface-transfer wire limits**
  - Covered by: `program-libs/interface/tests/transact.rs` `interface_transfer_validation_accepts_many_transfers_up_to_limit`, `interface_transfer_count_rejects_protocol_overflow_during_serialization`, `external_data_preimage_rejects_slice_overflow`; `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/interface_transfers.rs` `zero_interface_transfer_is_rejected`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: more than `MAX_INTERFACE_TRANSFERS` (255) legs returns 7031; any leg with amount 0 returns 7032.
  - Location: `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/instruction_data/transact.rs:77-87` (`fn validate_interface_transfers`), called from `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:48`
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TooManyInterfaceTransfers = 7031` / `ShieldedPoolError::ZeroInterfaceTransferAmount = 7032`
  - Severity: Medium
  - Suggested test: negative at the boundary (255 ok, 256 rejected; zero leg rejected); harness: mollusk unit

### Settlement Account Constraints

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-13: SOL settlement requires the canonical sol_interface PDA**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/settlement.rs` `sol_withdrawal_rejects_a_non_canonical_sol_interface`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: when the `interface_transfers` list carries a SOL leg (`SolDeposit` / `SolWithdrawal`), the `sol_interface` account address must equal the PDA derived from `[b"sol_interface", [0]]` under the program id; any other address returns Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/settlement/validate.rs:60-74` (`fn validate_sol_settlement`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSettlementAccounts = 7009`
  - Severity: Critical (fund theft)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-14: SPL settlement requires the canonical cpi_authority account**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/settlement.rs` `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_wrong_cpi_authority_account`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: on every SPL settlement leg (`SplDeposit` / `SplWithdrawal`), the account at the `cpi_authority` slot (first of the SPL account group) must be the canonical `SHIELDED_POOL_CPI_AUTHORITY` PDA; any other address returns Err. The check is defense-in-depth: `settle_spl_withdrawal` derives its signer from the hardcoded seed, and INV-TRANSACT-15 independently pins the vault's token-owner field to the same authority. (The retired piece is the `cpi_authority` INSTRUCTION-DATA field, which PR164 removed; the account slot and its validation remain live.)
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/settlement/validate.rs:77-83` (`fn validate_cpi_authority`), called from `transact/account.rs:78,84` on both SPL legs
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSettlementAccounts = 7009`
  - Severity: Medium (defense-in-depth)
  - Suggested test: none remaining (negative exists)

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-15: SPL vault must be the canonical per-mint vault PDA**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/settlement.rs` `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_non_canonical_vault`, `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_vault_user_mint_mismatch`, `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_vault_not_owned_by_the_cpi_authority`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: when the `interface_transfers` list carries an SPL leg (`SplDeposit` / `SplWithdrawal`), the vault address must equal the PDA derived from `[b"spl_asset_vault", mint]`, the vault and user token accounts must share one mint, and the vault's owner must be `SHIELDED_POOL_CPI_AUTHORITY`; any violation returns Err.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/settlement/validate.rs:85-121` (`fn validate_spl_settlement`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSettlementAccounts = 7009`
  - Severity: Critical (fund theft / liquidity split)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-16: SPL settlement token accounts must be initialized token-program accounts**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/settlement.rs` `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_user_token_account_not_owned_by_the_token_program`, `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_user_token_account_with_a_wrong_length`, `spl_withdrawal_rejects_an_uninitialized_user_token_account`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: every settlement token account (vault, user token account) must be owned by the settlement token program — SPL Token or Token-2022 (a wrong token-program account returns `UnsupportedSplTokenProgram = 7037`) — must unpack as `PodStateWithExtensions<PodAccount>` (extension-bearing Token-2022 accounts are legal; the exact-165 length rule is gone), and must have state `Initialized`; any other violation returns Err. (Token-2022 wording superseded by INV-TRANSACT-43.)
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/settlement/validate.rs:29-37, 85-121, 128-149` (`fn validate_token_program`, `fn validate_spl_settlement`, `fn read_token_account`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSettlementAccounts = 7009` / `ShieldedPoolError::UnsupportedSplTokenProgram = 7037`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [ ] **INV-TRANSACT-17: settlement addresses are included in external_data_hash**
  - Partial coverage: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `transact_rejects_tampered_public_amount` (recipient+amount tampering fails with 7008, but the settlement-address binding is not isolated from the amount binding)
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the recomputed `external_data_hash` public input appends, after the serialized instruction-data prefix, exactly two addresses per `interface_transfers` leg in leg order: the `sol_interface` PDA and the recipient address for a SOL leg, the mint and the user token account for an SPL leg. The leg's kind, direction, and amount are in the `InterfaceTransfer` encoding in the prefix. Substituting a settlement account after proving makes proof verification fail. The per-mint `spl_interface` PDA is not hashed; it is derived from the mint.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs` (`fn hash_external_data`, `push_settlement` per leg), `settlement/mod.rs` (`fn Settlement::committed_accounts`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical (withdrawal redirection)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-39: SPL deposit leg depositor must sign**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/interface_transfers.rs` `spl_deposit_requires_depositor_signature`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: for every `SplDeposit` leg, the `depositor` account (the transfer authority) must be a signer.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:56-57` (`fn from_iter`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::SplDepositorMustSign = 7036`
  - Severity: Critical (theft of third-party tokens)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-43: settlement token program must be SPL Token or Token-2022**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/interface_transfers.rs` `spl_withdrawal_rejects_a_shifted_token_program_account` (7037), `token_2022_withdrawal_accounts_reach_proof_verification`; `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/mixed_interface_transfers.rs` `token_2022_withdrawals_settle_independently` (positive legs); supersedes the stale wording of INV-TRANSACT-16
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: the `token_program` account must be the SPL Token or Token-2022 program id; vault and user token accounts must be owned by that program, unpack as `PodStateWithExtensions<PodAccount>` (extension-bearing Token-2022 accounts are legal — the exact-165 length rule is gone), and have state `Initialized`.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/settlement/validate.rs:29-37, 128-149` (`fn validate_token_program`, `fn read_token_account`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::UnsupportedSplTokenProgram = 7037` (bad program) / `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidSettlementAccounts = 7009` (bad accounts)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative (shifted token program); harness: mollusk unit

### Interface Transfers

- [x] **INV-TRANSACT-37: public-slot count and net-amount overflow gates**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/interface_transfers.rs` `four_distinct_public_assets_are_rejected`, `same_asset_aggregate_overflow_is_rejected`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: a batch of legs naming more distinct assets than the circuit's public slots returns 7033; a per-asset i128 net overflow or a net whose magnitude exceeds u64 returns 7034.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/interface_transfer.rs:54-72, 95-100` (`fn process_interface_transfers`, `fn checked_slot_amount`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TooManyPublicAssets = 7033` / `ShieldedPoolError::PublicAssetAmountOverflow = 7034`
  - Severity: High

  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: for every input slot -- spendable UTXO, address slot, or padding dummy -- the published nullifier is exactly the circuit-derived `Poseidon(utxo_hash, blinding, nullifier_secret)` and is proven non-included against the referenced nullifier-tree root; no slot type can carry a free (attacker-chosen) nullifier. This is the F-01 fix: unconstrained padding nullifiers could brick the nullifier queue.

  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: dummy and address inputs are allowed only if every input tree retains at least its UTXO tree's total capacity in free nullifier leaves after reserving this transaction's inputs assigned to that tree. Existing queue reservations count against capacity. Equality after the transaction is allowed. Below this threshold the on-chain `allow_dummy_inputs` public input is false, so proofs must contain only real spends. Deposits remain allowed, with capacity reserved for their eventual spends.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/tree.rs` (`fn apply_input_trees`), `program-libs/tree/src/lib.rs` (`fn dummy_input_headroom`); merge uses the same check in `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/merge/processor.rs`

  - Covered by: `program-tests/ring-test-program/tests/ring_lifecycle.rs` `invalid_proofs_and_disabled_authority_are_atomic`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_authority_transact` returns Err whenever the signing ring's `ring_authority_transact_is_enabled` field is exactly 0.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/account.rs:157-159` (`fn validate_and_parse`, `require_enabled = true`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::RingAuthorityTransactDisabled = 7020`
  - Severity: Critical (authority containment)
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-RING-AUTH-03: no input-owner signature is accepted or required**

  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_authority_transact` succeeds without any input-owner account signing, and rejects an owner-signer account run as `InvalidTransactShape`; the ring_config signature is the sole spend authorization.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:52-54, 60-62` (`fn process_transact_ix`, `CircuitId::RingAuthority` arm, `requires_input_signatures() == false`), `transact/account.rs:197`

### Proof Binding

- [x] **INV-RING-AUTH-04: ring-authority verifying keys cover exactly the square shapes**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/guard.rs` `ring_authority_transact_rejects_a_non_square_shape`, `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `ring_authority_transact_accepts_the_maximum_square_shape`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_authority_transact` verifies only for shapes `(1,1)`, `(2,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(4,4)`; every other `(inputs.len(), outputs.len())` returns Err.
  - Location: `program-libs/interface/src/verifying_keys/circuit.rs:92-94` (`fn is_supported`, `RingAuthority` arm)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::InvalidTransactShape = 7006`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-RING-AUTH-05: ring-authority proofs must use the uncommitted (non-P256) encoding**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/validate_circuit.rs` `selector_family_must_match_instruction`
  - Kind: precondition
  - Statement: `ring_authority_transact` accepts only the `CircuitId::RingAuthority` selector; a BSB22-committed `RingP256` selector (or any other family) under the authority tag is rejected by the pre-account selector-family validation. The authority rail itself carries no commitment: `TransactProof` is the plain 128-byte Groth16 triple.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:139-151` (`fn validate_circuit_type`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::MismatchedCircuitType = 7035`
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: negative per selector family (exists); harness: mollusk unit

- [x] **INV-RING-AUTH-06: authority variant folds no input-owner public inputs**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/circuit_vectors.rs` `program_assembly_matches_the_go_ordering_on_every_variant`
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: the `ring_authority_transact` public-input hash chain contains the base chain, `external_data_hash`, the interleaved public transfer slots, then `ring_program_id`, the bare `hash_bytes(payer)` element (a one-element signer "chain"), and `allow_dummy_inputs` (no output-owner chain).
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/verify.rs:192-202` (`fn public_input_hash`, authority selector omits both owner chains)
  - Severity: High
  - Suggested test: golden vector (exists: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/circuit_vectors.rs`); harness: `cargo nextest run -p shielded-pool-tests --test transact_circuit_vectors`

- [x] **INV-RING-AUTH-07: ring_program_id binds the signing ring**
  - Covered by: `program-tests/shielded-pool/tests/transact/functional.rs` `ring_authority_transact_rejects_a_proof_bound_to_a_different_ring`
  - Kind: postcondition
  - Statement: as for `ring_transact`, the `ring_program_id` public-input element is exactly `solana_pk_hash` of the signing `ring_config.program_id`; a ring authority cannot transition UTXOs of a different ring.
  - Location: `programs/shielded-pool/src/instructions/transact/processor.rs:60-65` (`fn process_transact_ix`)
  - Error: `ShieldedPoolError::TransactProofVerificationFailed = 7008`
  - Severity: Critical
  - Suggested test: negative; harness: program-tests integration (`cargo test-sbf`)
